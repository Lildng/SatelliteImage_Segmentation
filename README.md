Multispectral Image Segmentation: Terrain Feature Analysis &amp; Environmental Change Detection (U-Net &amp; U-TAE Models)

🌍 Satellite Image Segmentation with DynamicEarthNet
📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to reproduce semantic segmentation on satellite images from the DynamicEarthNet dataset. Our approach includes:

Building and exploring the multi-spectral dataset.
Applying advanced preprocessing techniques.
Designing a U-Net model from scratch.
Using a pre-trained U-Net model for segmentation.
Applying Data Augmentation techniques to enhance training.
⚠️ Due to storage and computational constraints, we used only a small portion of the available data.

📂 Dataset Overview
🔍 DynamicEarthNet: A Multi-Spectral Satellite Dataset
DynamicEarthNet is a collection of satellite images covering a two-year period (January 2018 – December 2019). It provides:

✔ Daily coverage of observed areas.
✔ Monthly annotations, updated when changes are detected.
✔ 4 spectral bands: Red (R), Green (G), Blue (B), and Near-Infrared (NIR).
✔ Advanced preprocessing to remove artifacts (e.g., clouds).

🌍 Class Distribution & Annotations
The dataset includes 75 Areas of Interest (AOI) across six continents. Each image is annotated into seven land cover categories:

Class	Percentage
🏙️ Impervious surfaces	7.1%
🌾 Agriculture	10.3%
🌲 Forest / Vegetation	44.9%
🏞️ Wetlands	0.7%
🏜️ Bare soil	28.0%
💧 Water	8.0%
❄️ Snow and ice	1.0%
📌 The first annotated image for each region serves as a reference, with annotations updated monthly based on detected changes.

📊 Labeled vs. Unlabeled Data
The dataset contains 54,750 satellite images, of which 1,800 are labeled with segmentation masks.
